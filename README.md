# Python-snake-gun-water
A simple, fun command-line game written in Python. This is a twist on the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where the player competes against the computer over 3 rounds. Each round, both sides choose between Snake, Gun, or Water â€” and the game keeps track of the score to determine the overall winner.
